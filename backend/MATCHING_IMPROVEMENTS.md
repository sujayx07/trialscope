# LLM Semantic Matching Improvements

## Problem
Previously, the trial matching system used a combination of LLM filtering and a deterministic keyword fallback. This caused issues where a search for "blood cancer" would match trials for "blood pressure" due to the shared keyword "blood". Additionally, generic terms like "cancer" were matching specific subtypes, which was not the intended "perfect match" behavior.

## Solution: Strict Medical Reasoning Layer
I have overhauled the matching logic to prioritize medical semantic meaning over keyword overlap.

### 1. Enhanced LLM Filtering (`llm_trial_filter.py`)
- **Removed Keyword Fallback**: The deterministic backfill has been removed. Only trials that are explicitly approved by the LLM are now shown to the patient.
- **Strict Matching Rules**:
    - **Perfect Condition Match**: Trials must treat the patient's specific condition.
    - **Medical Synonyms**: Understanding that "Leukemia" = "Blood Cancer".
    - **Stage Awareness**: Distinguishing between "Stage 4" (patient severity) and "Phase 4" (trial phase).
    - **No Partial Keywords**: Shared words like "blood" or "cancer" are no longer sufficient for a match.

### 2. Matching Agent Updates (`agent3_matching.py`)
- The internal matching agent now uses the same strict reasoning prompt to ensure consistency across the platform.

### 3. Verification
A new functional test suite has been implemented in `backend/test_semantic_matching.py` which confirms:
- **REJECTS**: Blood Cancer vs Blood Pressure
- **MATCHES**: Blood Cancer vs Leukemia (Synonym)
- **REJECTS**: Generic Cancer vs Specific Blood Cancer (Vague match)

## How to Test
Run the updated test script:
```bash
python backend/test_semantic_matching.py
```
This will run three precision scenarios and verify the LLM's reasoning.
