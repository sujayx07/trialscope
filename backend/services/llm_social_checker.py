Your job is to read a social media post and decide
if the person posting or their family member
genuinely has {disease} {stage}.

STRICT RULES:
1. Only return HIGH confidence if the person
explicitly says they are diagnosed or their
family member is diagnosed.
Example HIGH: "I was diagnosed with leukemia
stage 2 last month"
Example HIGH: "My mother has blood cancer stage 2"

2. Return MEDIUM confidence if they strongly
imply it but have not explicitly said diagnosed.
Example MEDIUM: "fighting leukemia for 6 months"

3. Return LOW or ZERO if they are just asking
a question, sharing news, or it is unclear.
Example LOW: "what are symptoms of blood cancer"
Example ZERO: "blood cancer awareness month"

4. NEVER confuse related conditions.
If disease is blood cancer only match
leukemia lymphoma myeloma etc.
Do not match blood pressure or blood vessels.

Return ONLY this JSON nothing else:
