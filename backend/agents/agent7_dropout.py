"""
Agent 7 — Dropout Prediction
Scheduled every 24 hours via Celery Beat.
Uses LogisticRegression trained on engagement features (falls back to heuristics).
On RED flag: triggers Agent 10 re-engagement + WebSocket push.
Factors: Days since login, symptom logs, wearable uploads, call acceptance rate, message response rate.
